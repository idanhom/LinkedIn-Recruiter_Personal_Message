Title: Sebratec - Your Growth. Our Goal.

Hi Mikael Jansson,

I'm Oscar and I work at Sebratec. We specialize in identifying top-tier talent who are not just looking for a job, but a place where they are valued and cared for. We care about swift hiring processes, without unnecessary extra steps.

I came across your profile and was quite impressed. Your deep-seated expertise in software development on embedded systems – especially your clear proficiency with Embedded Android and AOSP, is exactly the kind of skills that our client is seeking. Furthermore, your extensive experience, working with companies like Trimble and software4devices going through the full path from requirements to application firmware, not only reflects your technical prowess but shows that you are no stranger to high-pressure situations. Your practical approach to problem-solving and your proficiency in Android, Java, and Kotlin could make you a significant asset to the team.

I am contacting you because we are hiring for a position that you have highly relevant expertise for. I offer to pitch your profile directly to Troy, who is in charge of the recruitment process. Alternatively, if you know someone who might be a better fit for this role, feel free to pass this along to them.

How do you want to proceed, Mikael Jansson?

Do reply regardless, 

Oscar
