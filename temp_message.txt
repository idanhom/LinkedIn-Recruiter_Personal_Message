Title: Sebratec - Your Growth. Our Goal.

Hi Ismael V.,

I'm Oscar and I work at Sebratec. We specialize in identifying top-tier talent who are not just looking for a job, but a place where they are valued and cared for. We care about swift hiring processes, without unnecessary extra steps.

I noticed your extensive experience with Android development at Afry/Volvo and your impressive educational background in Computer Science from the Federal University of Amazonas. Your professional journey and skills with Java, Kotlin, and Android Platform Development caught my eye, they align perfectly with what we currently are seeking.

I am contacting you because we are hiring for a position that you have highly relevant expertise for. I offer to pitch your profile directly to Troy, who is in charge of the recruitment process. Alternatively, if you know someone who might be a better fit for this role, feel free to pass this along to them.

How do you want to proceed, Ismael V.?

Do reply regardless,

Oscar
