Title: Sebratec - Your Growth. Our Goal.

Hi Keshav Singh

I'm Oscar and I work at Sebratec. We specialize in identifying top-tier talent who are not just looking for a job, but a place where they are valued and cared for. We care about swift hiring processes, without unnecessary extra steps.

What caught my attention about your profile is your extensive experience working in Embedded and Software Architecture Design and Development within the Automotive and Aerospace sectors. Notably, your proficiency in AOSP and Android Automotive Development aligns with the particular skills we're seeking for the Android Developer role at Sebratec. On top of that, your expertise in Java, and Kotlin matched with your demonstrated experience with Git is highly impressive and in line with our job requirements.

I am contacting you because we are hiring for a position that you have highly relevant expertise for. I'd be happy to pitch your profile directly to Troy, who is in charge of the recruitment process. Alternatively, if you know someone who might be a better fit for this role, feel free to pass this along to them.
