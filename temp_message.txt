Title: Sebratec - Your Growth. Our Goal.

Hi Zouhour KHEDHER,

I'm Oscar and I work at Sebratec. We specialize in identifying top-tier talent who are not just looking for a job, but a place where they are valued and cared for. We care about swift hiring processes, without unnecessary extra steps.

Your profile immediately caught my attention due to your extensive experience with Android Open Source Project (AOSP) in prominent companies like Volvo Cars, MCA Sweden and Sagemcom. Notably, your involvement in the Android TV Platform development for Sagemcom Set-Top-Box and your work in integrating various modules in AOSP during your tenure at Sofia Technologies show a knack for innovation and problem solving. Your solid command of coding languages like C/C++ and recognized skills on Git further accent your qualifications. 

I strongly believe your expertise will align perfectly with the Android Developer role we're currently seeking to fill. I am contacting you because we are hiring for a position that you have highly relevant expertise for. I offer to pitch your profile directly to Troy, who is in charge of the recruitment process. Alternatively, if you know someone who might be a better fit for this role, feel free to pass this along to them.

Do reply regardless,

Oscar
