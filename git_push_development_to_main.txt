Merging and Pushing Changes from Development to Main:
If you've made changes in the development branch and want to reflect those changes in the main branch, follow this step-by-step guide:

1. Switch to the Main Branch:
Use the command git checkout main.

What it does: This switches your active branch to main.
Why: Before merging changes into main, you need to be on the main branch.
2. Update the Main Branch:
Use the command git pull.

What it does: Fetches the latest changes from the remote main branch and updates your local main branch.
Why: It's essential to ensure your local main branch is up-to-date with any changes that might have been made by others before you merge your changes.
3. Merge the Development Branch into Main:
Use the command git merge development.

What it does: This merges the changes from the development branch into your currently active main branch.
Why: To integrate the new changes or features you've added in development into the main branch.
4. Push the Updated Main Branch to GitHub:
Use the command git push.

What it does: This uploads your updated main branch to GitHub.
Why: To ensure the main branch on GitHub reflects the latest changes you've just merged.
After completing these steps, the changes you made in the development branch will be present in the main branch on GitHub.

Note: For solo projects or smaller collaborations, directly merging development into main can be sufficient. However, for larger projects or when collaborating with a team, consider using Pull Requests on GitHub when merging into main. This provides an opportunity for code review, discussions, and additional validation, ensuring the quality and stability of the code.
